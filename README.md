**For HHA507 Assignment 4 Part 2**



**This repo aims to practice descriptive statistics by learning**:
1. What numerical quantities you can use to describe, how to calculate them in python, and summarize your datasets
2. How to calculate descriptive statistics in pure Python
3. How to get descriptive statistics with available Python libraries
4. How to visualize your datasets

**Learning Libraries**
